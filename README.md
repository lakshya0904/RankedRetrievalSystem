# Vector Space Based Ranked Retrieval System

Assignment done as part of my <u>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL course</u> at BITS Pilani.

### Problem Statement Part 1:
Implementation of a vector space-based information retrieval system with the following characteristics:
1. The vector space model should be used for computing the score between document and query.
2. Use the lnc.ltc scoring scheme (based on SMART notation).
3. The queries should be free-text queries.
4. Retention of stop words, removal of punctuations and stemming/lemmatization and normalization shouldn't be done.

### Problem Statement Part 2:
Improve the retrieval and ranking for the documents. Further, answer following questions for each proposed improvement:
1. What are the issues with the vector space model built in part 1?
2. What improvement are you proposing?
3. How will the proposed improvement address that issue?
4. A corner case (if any) where this improvement might not work or can have an adverse effect.
5. Demonstrate the actual impact of the improvement. Give three queries, where the improvement yields better results compared to the Part 1 implementation.
